# An Windows app to quickly swap Remix Mod from your Blazblue Centralfiction

![image](https://i.imgur.com/BeKA8eP.png)

I made this 3+ years ago when I was learning [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) and forgot to upload it here.

### Running without compiling:

Just `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `app.py`

### Compiling:

Do the pip installation above, but run `compiler.py` instead. The compiled app will be inside the `dist` folder.

### License:

Under MIT. I don't own the Mod itself and obviously not Blazblue. If you want the Mod, head to its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kuK32CVtBQ).
